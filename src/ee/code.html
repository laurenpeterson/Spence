<h2>Engagement Matters</h2>

<p>Too often investors don&rsquo;t engage in their finances to the same extent they do with other areas in life, like health or work or home. We know engagement can play an important role in helping investors make sound decisions and generate better outcomes. We see it work every day.</p>

<p>Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc. The chart illustrates the growth in value of saving 10% of annual salary invested according to a glide path. The saver began with the Schwab Aggressive Model Plan until age 39, when the allocation shifts to the Moderately Aggressive Model. As the saver approaches retirement (age 52), the allocation shifts down to the Moderate Model. The saver is a 25-year old in 1973, whose 1973 salary of $18,580 is assumed to grow at 3% annual inflation and an additional 10% due to promotion every 5 years to reach $100,000 in 2008. The asset allocation plan is weighted averages of the performance of the indices used to represent each asset class in the plans and are rebalanced annually.</p>

<p>Returns include reinvestment of dividends and interest. The indices representing each asset class are S&amp;P 500&reg; Index (large-cap stocks), Russell 2000&reg; Index (small-cap stocks), MSCI EAFE&reg; Net of Taxes (international stocks), Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (bonds), and Citigroup U.S. 3-month Treasury bills (cash investments). The Aggressive allocation is 50% large-cap stocks, 20% small-cap stocks, 25% international stocks, and 5% cash investments. The Moderately Aggressive allocation is 45% large-cap stocks, 15% small-cap stocks, 20% international stocks, 15% bonds, and 5% cash investments. The Moderate allocation is 35% large-cap stocks, 10% small-cap stocks, 15% international stocks, 35% bonds, and 5% cash investments. CRSP 6-8 was used for small-cap stocks prior to 1979, Ibbotson Intermediate-Term Government Bond Index was used for bonds prior to 1976, and Ibbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury Bill Index was used for cash investments prior to 1978. Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.</p>

<h4>Schwab Embraces 24/7 Service</h4>

<p>The accepted rule was that firms closed when the markets closed. Schwab understood that clients didn&rsquo;t keep bankers&rsquo; hours and chose to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service.</p>

<h3>1992</h3>

<h4>Mutual Funds: Access, Convenience, Low Cost</h4>

<p>Mutual fund investors used to face sales loads and other transaction fees through their broker or had to set up multiple accounts with multiple mutual fund companies to buy direct without transaction fees. Schwab thought this an unnecessary compromise and created Schwab Mutual Fund OneSource® a one-stop way to invest in a wide array of no-load funds without transaction fees.<sup>1</sup></p>

<h3>1996</h3>

<h4>Low-Cost Online Trading</h4>

<p>At the risk of substantial cuts to its commission revenue, Schwab embraced low-cost online investing in the early days of the internet because it benefited the consumer.</p>

<h3>2002</h3>

<h4>Quantitative Fact-Based Ratings</h4>

<p>Investors deserved a fact-based system to assess whether a stock was right to consider buying, selling or holding. Stock lists at traditional firms were biased toward &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and depended heavily on qualitative, subjective assessments. Schwab didn&rsquo;t think that benefited clients, so it launched Schwab Equity Ratings, a system that ranked over 3000 stocks, with equal numbers of buys and sells.</p>

<p>Clients should have easy access to their money at all times, whether depositing a check or investing in a mutual fund. That&rsquo;s why Schwab Bank created its High-Yield Investor Checking account, to provide investors with banking without unnecessary costs.</p>

<h4>Affordable Professional Investment Advice</h4>

<p>Managed portfolios provide a convenient way to access professional investment advice, but the cost had been historically high. Schwab Managed Portfolio addressed this by providing broadly diversified portfolios with competitive costs.</p>

<h3>2009</h3>

<h4>Commission-Free ETFs</h4>

<p>ETFs provide a great way to get access to a range of asset classes and to build a diversified portfolio. But with commissions, an investor who dollar-cost averages can have their investment undercut by expenses. Commission-free ETFs at Schwab broke new ground by making it possible to build a low-cost diversified portfolio simply<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h3>2012</h3>

<h4>A New 401(k) Option</h4>

<p>Personalized low-cost advice may help 401(k) participants reach their retirement goals and achieve better outcomes, but they typically receive single-factor advice found in target-date funds. Schwab Retirement Plan Services, Inc. (SRPS) believed there was another way, so developed Schwab Index Advantage&reg;, a ground-breaking approach to the 401(k) combining low-cost index mutual funds or exchange traded funds offered through SRPS, an FDIC-insured deposit feature, and professional savings and investment advice provided by an independent third-party advisor.</p>

<h4>Accountability As Policy</h4>

<p>At Schwab, we believe that every investor deserves accountability. The Schwab Accountability Guarantee&trade; provides that, if for any reason, a client is not happy with one of our participating investment advisory services, we&rsquo;ll refund the client&rsquo;s service fee from the previous quarter.<sup>3</sup> While it&#39;s no guarantee against loss, and other fees and expenses may still apply, we stand by our word and will work with the client to make things right.</p>

<p>Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).</p>

<p>Outcomes are not guaranteed.  </p>

<p>Fund operating expenses represent the total of all of a fund's annual fund operating expenses. Management fees are one component of the fund operating expenses. Index funds generally have low management fees because they don't have to pay investment managers to actively manage underlying investments.</p>

<p>Schwab Equity Ratings and the general buy/hold/sell guidance are not personal recommendations for any particular investor or client and do not take into account the financial, investment or other objectives or needs of, and may not be suitable for, any particular investor or client. Investors and clients should consider Schwab Equity Ratings as only a single factor in making their investment decision while taking into account the current market environment. </p>

<p>Schwab Equity Ratings are assigned to approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) U.S. headquartered stocks using a scale of A, B, C, D and F. Schwab's outlook is that A-rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and F-rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months. Each of the approximately 3,000 stocks rated in the Schwab Equity Ratings universe is given a score that is derived from several research factors. The assignment of a final Schwab Equity Rating depends on how well a given stock scores on each of the factors and then how that stock stacks up against all other rated stocks.</p>

				<p>Investors deserved a fact-based system to assess whether a stock was right to consider buying, selling or holding.

Schwab didn’t think that benefited clients, so it launched Schwab Equity Ratings, a system that ranked over 3000 stocks, with equal numbers of buys and sells.</p>

			<p>Source: Schwab Center for Financial Research with data provided by Morningstar, Inc. The chart illustrates the growth in value of saving 10% of annual salary invested according to a glide path.  The saver began with the Schwab Aggressive Model Plan until age 39, when the allocation shifts to the Moderately Aggressive Model. As the saver approaches retirement (age 52), the allocation shifts down to the Moderate Model. The saver is a 25-year old in 1973, whose 1973 salary of $18,580 is assumed to grow at 3% annual inflation and an additional 10% due to promotion every 5 years to reach $100,000 in 2008. The asset allocation plan is weighted averages of the performance of the indices used to represent each asset class in the plans and are rebalanced annually.  Returns include reinvestment of dividends and interest. The indices representing each asset class are S&amp;P 500&reg; Index (large-cap stocks), Russell 2000&reg; Index (small-cap stocks), MSCI EAFE&reg; Net of Taxes (international stocks), Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (bonds), and Citigroup U.S. 3-month Treasury bills (cash investments). The Aggressive allocation is 50% large-cap stocks, 20% small-cap stocks, 25% international stocks, and 5% cash investments. The Moderately Aggressive allocation is 45% large-cap stocks, 15% small-cap stocks, 20% international stocks, 15% bonds, and 5% cash investments. The Moderate allocation is 35% large-cap stocks, 10% small-cap stocks, 15% international stocks, 35% bonds, and 5% cash investments. CRSP 6-8 was used for small-cap stocks prior to 1979, Ibbotson Intermediate-Term Government Bond Index was used for bonds prior to 1976, and Ibbotson U.S. 30-day Treasury Bill Index was used for cash investments prior to 1978.  Indices are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly. <strong>Past performance is no indication of future results.</strong></p>
