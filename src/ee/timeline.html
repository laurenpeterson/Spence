<h3>1975</h3>

<h4>Chuck Schwab Creates a Discount Brokerage</h4>

<p>When the SEC deregulated securities commissions, many Wall Street firms raised their commissions. Chuck Schwab cut his and established one of the first discount brokerages.</p>

<h3>1982</h3>

<h4>Schwab Embraces 24/7 Service</h4>

<p>The accepted rule was that firms closed when the markets closed. Schwab understood that clients didn&rsquo;t keep bankers&rsquo; hours and chose to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service.</p>
</div>

<div class="event-marker event-top-tall-marker marker-year-1982">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="timeline-event year-1987 event-bottom"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>1987</h3>

<h4>Financial Advisor Service Launches</h4>

<p>Serving independent investment advisors, Financial Advisor Service exceeds $1 billion in client assets after just one year of business.</p>

<div class="timeline-event year-1992 event-top"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>1992</h3>

<h4>Mutual Funds: Access, Convenience, Low Cost</h4>

<p>Mutual fund investors used to face sales loads and other transaction fees through their broker or had to set up multiple accounts with multiple mutual fund companies to buy direct without transaction fees. Schwab thought this an unnecessary compromise and created Schwab Mutual Fund OneSource® a one-stop way to invest in a wide array of no-load funds without transaction fees.<sup>1</sup></p>

<div class="timeline-event year-1996 event-top-tall"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>1996</h3>

<h4>Low-Cost Online Trading</h4>

<p>At the risk of substantial cuts to its commission revenue, Schwab embraced low-cost online investing in the early days of the internet because it benefited the consumer.</p>
</div>

<div class="event-marker event-top-tall-marker marker-year-1996">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="timeline-event year-2002 event-bottom"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>2002</h3>

<h4>Quantitative Fact-Based Ratings</h4>

<p>Investors deserved a fact-based system to assess whether a stock was right to consider buying, selling or holding. Stock lists at traditional firms were biased toward &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and depended heavily on qualitative, subjective assessments. Schwab didn&rsquo;t think that benefited clients, so it launched Schwab Equity Ratings, a system that ranked over 3000 stocks, with equal numbers of buys and sells.</p>
</div>

<div class="timeline-event year-2005 event-top"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>2005</h3>

<h4>Checking Meets Investing</h4>

<p>Clients should have easy access to their money at all times, whether depositing a check or investing in a mutual fund. That&rsquo;s why Schwab Bank created its High-Yield Investor Checking account, to provide investors with banking without unnecessary costs.</p>
</div>

<div class="timeline-event year-2006 event-bottom-tall"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>2006</h3>

<h4>Affordable Professional Investment Advice</h4>

<p>Managed portfolios provide a convenient way to access professional investment advice, but the cost had been historically high. Schwab Managed Portfolio addressed this by providing broadly diversified portfolios with competitive costs.</p>
</div>

<div class="event-bottom-tall-marker event-marker marker-year-2006">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="timeline-event year-2009 event-top-tall"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>2009</h3>

<h4>Commission-Free ETFs</h4>

<p>ETFs provide a great way to get access to a range of asset classes and to build a diversified portfolio. But with commissions, an investor who dollar-cost averages can have their investment undercut by expenses. Commission-free ETFs at Schwab broke new ground by making it possible to build a low-cost diversified portfolio simply<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<div class="timeline-event year-2012 event-bottom"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>2012</h3>

<h4>A New 401(k) Option</h4>

<p>Personalized low-cost advice may help 401(k) participants reach their retirement goals and achieve better outcomes, but they typically receive single-factor advice found in target-date funds. Schwab Retirement Plan Services, Inc. (SRPS) believed there was another way, so developed Schwab Index Advantage&reg;, a ground-breaking approach to the 401(k) combining low-cost index mutual funds or exchange traded funds offered through SRPS, an FDIC-insured deposit feature, and professional savings and investment advice provided by an independent third-party advisor.</p>

<h3>2013</h3>

<h4>Accountability As Policy</h4>

<p>At Schwab, we believe that every investor deserves accountability. The Schwab Accountability Guarantee&trade; provides that, if for any reason, a client is not happy with one of our participating investment advisory services, we&rsquo;ll refund the client&rsquo;s service fee from the previous quarter.<sup>3</sup> While it&#39;s no guarantee against loss, and other fees and expenses may still apply, we stand by our word and will work with the client to make things right.</p>

<div class="timeline-event year-2015 event-top"><img alt="expand" class="event-open" src="../assets/images/timeline-open-button.png" />
<h3>2015</h3>

<h4>Automated and Simple Investing</h4>

<p>Many investors want and need help managing their money but don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on it and don&rsquo;t want to pay a fee for the service. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios&trade;, offered by Schwab Wealth Investment Advisory, Inc., is an online investment advisory service that builds, monitors, and rebalances your portfolio automatically, making access to automated portfolio management convenient and with no advisory fees, account service fees, or commissions charged.</p>

<p>Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF.

<p>Outcomes are not guaranteed.  </p>

<p>Fund operating expenses represent the total of all of a fund's annual fund operating expenses. Management fees are one component of the fund operating expenses. Index funds generally have low management fees because they don't have to pay investment managers to actively manage underlying investments.</p>

<p>Schwab Equity Ratings and the general buy/hold/sell guidance are not personal recommendations for any particular investor or client and do not take into account the financial, investment or other objectives or needs of, and may not be suitable for, any particular investor or client. Investors and clients should consider Schwab Equity Ratings as only a single factor in making their investment decision while taking into account the current market environment. </p>

<p>Schwab Equity Ratings are assigned to approximately 3,000 of the largest (by market capitalization) U.S. headquartered stocks using a scale of A, B, C, D and F. Schwab's outlook is that A-rated stocks, on average, will strongly outperform and F-rated stocks, on average, will strongly underperform the equities market over the next 12 months. Each of the approximately 3,000 stocks rated in the Schwab Equity Ratings universe is given a score that is derived from several research factors. The assignment of a final Schwab Equity Rating depends on how well a given stock scores on each of the factors and then how that stock stacks up against all other rated stocks.</p>
