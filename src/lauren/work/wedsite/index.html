					<h3>Details</h3>
					<p class="subhead">Lauren Peterson and Brian Spence shall be married on July 11, 2015 at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
					<p> We're so excited to share with you on this day and really publicly celebrate the way that God has blessed us with a love and a home and a story. We hope you can come and experience the garden and the wine and the exquisite company, but also the beautiful significance of this event - that we are committing fully to one another forever and eagerly expecting all the wholeness and hardship and fruitfullnes that this relationship will continue to bring to us. </p>
					<p>The ceremony and reception will be at Oakleigh, the given name for Lauren's family home. We will be outside in the midst of flowers and grasses and gophers, so plan your footwear and sun-protection accordingly. For the reception, we will enjoy dinner, drinks, cake, heartfelt toasts, dancing by us, dancing by you - all the good wedding things. If you happen to be one of our many vegan or vegitarian friends, worry not, we will have culinary options for you.</p>

					<div class="registry">
						<a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/EMPK96LJZQLQ" target="_blank">Amazon Registry</a>
						<p>Amazon has the majority of our registry. Find an assortement of things from fancy baking tools to a tent of our very own. And beyond. </p>

					<div class="registry">
						<a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/laurenbrian" target="_blank">Zola Registry</a>
						<p>People have been asking for what we want that's not on our registry. We'd really love the fancy shmancy art album our photographer offers. In steps Zola, which will help you contribute whatever you can to the overall cost of this beautiful (yet expensive) thing. </p>

					<h3>Directions</h3>
					
					<p>Oakleigh is the wedding location, but we ask that most wedding guests park just down the street from Oakleigh at the Montecito Covenant Church. To get from the Montecito Covenant Church to the venue, please walk out to Cold Spring Road, and go north up the street the direction you drove in. On your left, there will be two driveways for 801 Cold Spring Rd. Walk past the first one (801 South) to the second (801 North). There will be a stone wall on your left. Head up the driveway and make a beeline for those orange trees. You've arrived! </p>

					<h3>Accomodations</h3>
					<p class="subhead">Book a place to rest your head before and after the festivities.</p>
					
					
					<p>There are plenty of hotels in Santa Barbara that would be lovely for a few-night stay in July, but here are a few we recommend for their location and price. We recommend booking your lodgings as soon as possible so that the more economical options do not fill up without you.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.cabrilloinn.com/" target="_blank">Cabrillo Inn</a>
							<p>The Cabrillo Inn is close to the wedding action and close to the beach. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.motel6.com/reservations/motel_detail.aspx?num=1" target="_blank">Motel 6 by the Beach</a>
							<p>Close to the venue and one of the most cost-effective options, this is a uniquely nice Motel 6.</p>
