		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm Stephen Hill and I'm a software engineer. Two and half years ago, I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in Graphic Communication and a minor in English. Since then I've worked at a local Marketing Agency as a front-end developer. "Agency Life" means my work has been entirely project-based, and the type of projects I've gotten to work on span the gamut. I've contributed to cutting-edge javascript apps and sites, and I've made my copy-paste fingers sore entering content for the agency's custom-built app. I've worked with myriad content management systems, including AEM, Wordpress, and Expression Engine, as well as built many a page from scratch, using CSS pre-processors, tempating languages, and build tools.</p>
