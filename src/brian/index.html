		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm Brian Spence and I'm a computer engineer. Three years ago, I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in Computer Engineering. Since then, I've been writing software for a local U.S. Military contractor and have learned and grown a lot. When I'm not coding at work or doing side coding projects at home, I rock climb with my wife Lauren, walk with my dog Otto, and do everything else while being solicited for attention by my loud cat Samwise.</p>
