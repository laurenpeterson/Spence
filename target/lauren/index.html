		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm Lauren Spence and I'm a front-end web developer. Contrary to popular beleif, I don't own a pug. Why do people keep asking that? I do own a weiner dog though, and a cat named Samwise, thanks for asking. In my time spent not developing pug-sites, I chill with my husband, make intermittent stabs at exercise, and have fun returning to the Library every three weeks and thinking this makes me old-worldly and edgy. I live in San Luis Obispo California, which is the prettiest darn city this side of anything. </p>

		<h2 class="slide-trigger">v profesh</h2>
		<p>Two and half years ago, I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in Graphic Communication and a minor in English. Since then I've worked at a local Marketing Agency as a front-end developer. "Agency Life" means my work has been entirely project-based, and the type of projects I've gotten to work on span the gamut. I've contributed to cutting-edge javascript apps and sites, and I've made my copy-paste fingers sore entering content for the agency's custom-built app. I've worked with myriad content management systems, including AEM, Wordpress, and Expression Engine, as well as built many a page from scratch, using CSS pre-processors, tempating languages, and build tools.</p>
